<h2>Concept Statement</h2>
<p>In the modern age, technology is very prominent in schools across the United States. This technology is being used for a variety of uses, such as virtual classrooms, learning management systems, collaboration, and more. These programs are useful for fostering student engagement. One of the main challenges of k-12 teachers is keeping students attentive and motivated to learn. This can be solved by making the learning environment more fun. Our application, The Learning Lab, can help with that. The Learning Lab offers a variety of games for teachers to choose from that they can customize with their classroom content. These include: ordering games, matching games, drag and drop, a quiz maker, and more. The teacher can create a "classroom" and add all of his or her students to this classroom to share these review games with them. Each student will have a profile, and as they successfully complete games, they will gain achievements. This gamified form of learning will help educators make the classroom more fun and engaging for students. </p>
